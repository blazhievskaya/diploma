This project is devoted to the problem of distribution of two analytic forms in future tense in Polish.
There are 2 branches here: github pages and the branch with all files. With the help of Github pages I can post statistical data and others can see them as .html pages with links. 
In the second one there are 2 folders: scripts and r. In R folder there are all R files.
You can just thses scripts on your computer and see all results or just read .rmd file (it helps to see the code in .docx)
In scripts folder there are .php and .py files. You can also run them on your computer.
